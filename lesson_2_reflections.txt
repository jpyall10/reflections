What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository it creates the .git file necessary to create the metadata for a git repository. I need to do this to be able to use git commands like, git log, git status, git diff, etc.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is not saved as a commit but is ready to. It shows what changes are ready to be committed
