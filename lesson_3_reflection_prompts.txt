When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When working from multiple computers/locations or working with multiple users

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because you may have local work that you are not ready to put on github but is still good work that needs to be finished

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks only happen on gitHub. Clones are when a repository is copied but does not care about keeping a relationship with the source
