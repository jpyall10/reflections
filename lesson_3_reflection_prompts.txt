When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When working from multiple computers/locations or working with multiple users

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because you may have local work that you are not ready to put on github but is still good work that needs to be finished
